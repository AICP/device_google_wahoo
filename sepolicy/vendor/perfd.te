# TODO(b/34274385): Remove this once HALs are guaranteed to not be run in passthrough mode
# What's going on here is that Audio HAL, Power and DRM HAL are talking over sockets to perfd,
# which is permitted. However, those rules target hal_x rather than hal_x_server and thus are also
# granted to all clients of these HALs (e.g., system_server) which are core components, and
# socket communications between system components and vendor components are not permted.
# Once we switch full Treble devices to binderized only mode, this issue will disappear.
